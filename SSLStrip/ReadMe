A tool to convert HTTPS to HTTP.
use "sudo apt-get install sslstrip" to install this tool.

Another tool, "dsniff", is to sniff a victim's DNS queries.
Also install this tool using apt-get.

Tool "arpspoof", to trick router into thinking that I am someone else.


In conclusion, I understand how to use arpspoof to trick a victim into believing me to be his gateway. But after that, on my Linux, why redirect all traffic? How SSLStrip works? I don't know...

Gonna dig deeper on sslstrip if the need emerges. For now, the takeaway from this is arpspoof.
