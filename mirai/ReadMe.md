# Mirai BotNet source code
Paying my tribute to Anna-senpai.
This folder contains my study on the infamous Mirai malware.

The [Mirai-Source-Code](https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code) folder is git cloned from Jerry Gamblin. Keep this folder untouched!   
My analysis are under StudyNote folder.
