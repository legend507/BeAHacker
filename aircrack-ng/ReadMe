---------------aircrack-ng-------------------
Background: aircrack-ng has a set of tools (i.e., airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, etc.). There tools enable a user to mess with WiFi Access Point, brute force password and so on.

The following is a step-by-step instruction on how to DoS a WiFi AP: 
1. ./1setWirelessCardToMonitorMode, to set wireless card to monitor mode
2. ./2checkTroublesomeProcesses, to check the processes that may cause trouble (e.g., trigger reboot)
3. ./3beginMonitorAll, to monitor all wifi access points information
4. ./4beginMonitorSpecifyChannel, to monitor a specific WiFi AP, and print the result to a file; by doing this you can find the MAC of connected devices
5. ./5deAuthenticateAllDevices, to send DeAuth messages to the WiFi AP and cut connecting to ALL devices
[SUMMARY] 1,2 prepares to mintor; 3 lists all WiFi APs; 4 lists all connected devices to a specific WiFi AP; 5 executes DoS attack and cut all connections between devices and this WiFi AP.

6. ./6passwordBruteForce, do this after 4. 4 should output a .cap file, and 6 uses this .cap file as an input. Combine with crunch tools, 6 can brute force a WiFi AP.



------------------------reaver--------------------------
Background: There is a PIN code (usually 8 digits, in decimal) in a router, reaver crake this PIN code by accutally sending packets to the router. (Unlike aircrack-ng, who cracks captured communication log, reaver does Over-The-Air attack.)

Before execute 1, set my wireless interface to monitor mode first.
Refer to ./aircrack-ng's 1, 2, 3.
1. do ./aircrack-ng 1, 2, 3.

After setting wireless interface to monitor mode, execute 1 to list all vulnerable WiFi APs.
2. ./7washWirelessInterface, in output, check 'WPS Locked'. If it says 'NO', the WiFi AP is vulnerable! Otherwise, reaver is useless. (After trying this on my router, I found that Router PIN Access will lock down after a few tries. Don't know how to solve this...)

----------------Conclusion-----------------
Aircrack-ng is useful, for it can find what device is connected to a WiFi AP and DoS to cut those connections.
Reaver, however, is not useful.
